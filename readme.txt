   +++ INSTALLATION & EDITING +++

   - Copy all the files from the 'site' directory to the appropriate (usually 'www' or 'public_html') directory on your hosting. That's it.
   - This template may be edited with any HTML editor. If you do not know where to get one, you may consider trying NotePad++. It can be downloaded at notepad-plus.sourceforge.net and it's free.



   +++ HOW TO PUT YOUR OWN LOGO+++

   You need to replace logo.png (it is located in site>images>logo.png) with your own .png file. 


   +++ IMPORTANT NOTICE +++

   My free templates are produced according to the latest web standards and iâ€™ve been trying to make the process of working with them as easy as possible, so for people with minimum web develpment 
   experience it should be easy to work with them.
